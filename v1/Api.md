# Api v1

## Empty?
Currently, API v1 is deprecated, and because of that, everything except of the Gateway, was deleted.   
If you were using API v1 in your app, please switch on API v2, as your app won't work.

## But why?
Because we rewrited many things for second version of API, and first version wasn't compatible with these changes, and because it was deprecated, we decided that it is easier to delete all the code, instead of rewriting it.
